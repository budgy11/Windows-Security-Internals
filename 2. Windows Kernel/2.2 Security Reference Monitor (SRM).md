- Implements security mechanisms to restrict user access to different resources
- Manages access tokens assigned on process creation to id the user associated to the process using access checks
	- Access checks queries the security descriptor of a resource and compares to the access token
- Generates audit events for accessing resources
	- disabled by default
- SRM reads users and groups in binary security identifiers (SIDs)
- Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS) converts names to SIDs
- Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL) format represents SIDs as strings
	- S-1-5-32-545 for Users groupS
		- S is for SDDL SIDs
		- 1 is the SID structure in decimal. Fixed to 1
		- 5 is the security authority. 5 indicates built-in NT authority
		- 32 and 545 are relative Identifiers (RIDs). 32 and 545 represent the NT authority group
```powershell
Get-NtSid -Name "Users"
Get-NtSid -Sddl "S-1-5-32-545"
