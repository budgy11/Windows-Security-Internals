- Everything is an object on Windows
	- with a security descriptor
- Object manager is responsible for managing resource object, memory allocations, and lifetimes.
### Object Types
```powershell
Get-NtType #list of supported object types
Get-NtType | Format-List #list of supported object types with property information
```

### Object Manager Namespace (OMNS)
- Built out of directory objects
	- Objects act as if in a filesystem
	- Full paths can be specifies with backslash string (uses book's PowerShell module)
```powershell
ls NtObject:\ | Sort-Object Name
ls NtObject:\Dfs | Select-Object SymbolicLinkTarget #get target of symbolic link target
Get-Item NtObject:\Device\DfsClient | Format-Table 
```
#### Default Object Directories
| Path              | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \BaseNamedObjects | Global dir for user objects                      |
| \GLOBAL??         | Global dir for symlinks, includes drive mappings |
| \KnownDlls        | Dir with special known DLL mappings              |
| \ObjectTypes      | Dir with named object types                      |
| \Sessions         | Dir for separate console session                 |
| \Windows          | Dir for objects related to the Window manager    |
| \RPC Control      | Dir for RPC endpoints                            |

- BaseNamedObjects(BNO) allows any user to create named kernel objects
	- sharing of resources between users on the local system
### System Calls
- Allows accessing named objects from user-mode applications
- Usually perform an operation on a specific kernel object type
	- `NtCreateMutant` creates `Mutant` objects.
- Naming is `Zw|Nt` followed by the Operation Verb and then a name relating to the kernel object type
	- `Zw` changes security checking process when invoked by code executed in the kernel
	- `Create`, `Open`, `QueryInformation`, and `SetInformation` are common syscall verbs

#### NtCreateMutant C Prototype
```c
NTSTATUS NtCreateMutant(
HANDLE* FileHandle,
ACCESS_MASK DesiredAccess,
OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES* ObjectAttributes,
BOOLEAN InitialOwner
);
```
- Starts with outbound pointer to a HANDLE
	- Allows access to properties and performing operations
- `DesiredAccess` represents operations the caller wants the ability to perform
- `ObjectAttributes` are the the attributes for the object to open/create
#### OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES Struct
```c
struct OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES {
ULONG Length;
HANDLE RootDirectory;
UNICODE_STRING* ObjectName;
ULONG Attributes;
PVOID SecurityDescriptor;
PVOID SecurityQualityOfService;
}
```
- `RootDirectory` and `ObjectName` are used to look up a resource to access
	- `\BaseNamedObjects\ABC` can be ObjectName = `\BaseNamedObjects\ABC` or RootDirectory = `\BaseNamedObjects` with ObjectName = `ABC`
- `Attributes` is a set of flags to mod the object name lookup or change the handle's properties
##### Attribute Flags Ts

| PowerShell Name             | Description                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inherit                     | Marks the handle inheritable                                                                                             |
| Permanent                   | Marks the handle as permanent                                                                                            |
| Exclusive                   | Marks the handle as exclusive if creating a new object. Only the same proc can open a handle to the object               |
| CaseInsensitive             | Object name lookup is case insensitive                                                                                   |
| OpenIf                      | Opens a handle to an existing object if available for Create calls                                                       |
| OpenLink                    | pens the object if it's a link to another object or follow the link otherwise. Only used by the config manager<br>       |
| KernelHandle                | Opens handle as a kernel handle when used in kernel mode. Prevents user-mode applications from accessing handle directly |
| ForceAccessCheck            | Forces all access checks are performed when used in kernel mode                                                          |
| IgnoreImpersonatedDeviceMap | Disables the device map when impersonating                                                                               |
| DontReparse                 | Avoids following paths that contain a symlink                                                                            |
