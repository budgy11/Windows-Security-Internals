implementation split between kernel and user mode
![[Win32 GUI Modules.png]]

- WIN32U implements syscall stubs in place of NTDLL
- Systemcalls implemented in WIN32K driver instead of NTOS kernel executive
- GUI APIs interact with Client Server Runtime Subsystem (CSRSS) which handles some privileged operations
## GUI Kernel Resources
4 types of kernel resources
1. Windows Stations - objects that represent the connection to the screen and user interface
2. Windows - GUI elements for interacting with the user, input, display
3. Desktops - Objects that represent the visible desktop
4. Drawing Resources - Bitmaps, fonts, anything else that needs to be displayed to the user
