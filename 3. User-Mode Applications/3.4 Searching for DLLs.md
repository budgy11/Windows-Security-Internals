- Path searching algorithm used by LoadLibrary API in Windows NT 3.1(OLD)
1. The same directory as the current processes's exe
2. The current working directory
3. The Windows System32 directory
4. The Windows directory
5. Each semicolon separated location in PATH
	- This can lead to loading DLLs from insecure locations i.e using SetCurrentDirectory to a location that has write perms for low level user
- Path searching algorithm since Vista
1. The same directory as the current processes's exe
2. The Windows System32 directory
3. The Windows directory
4. The current working directory
5. Each semicolon separated location in PATH

## DLL File Extension
- `.DLL` is added automatically if no extension is specified (This can lead to security issues )
- If the file ends in a period then the period is stripped and the file has no extension
## Pre-initialized DLLs
- KERNEL32 and NTDLL
- KnownDlls OMNS directory
